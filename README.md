# ECON 50: Using Big Data to Solve Economic and Social Problems - Harvard University

This repository contains my projects, lab assignments, and solutions for **Econ 50 / SUP 135** taught by **Professor Raj Chetty** at Harvard University. In this course, I used big data to analyze key social and economic challenges, such as equality of opportunity, education, health outcomes, climate change, and criminal justice. The assignments leverage modern data science techniques, allowing me to address these issues from a quantitative perspective.

## Course Overview

**Course Title**: Using Big Data to Solve Economic and Social Problems  
**Instructor**: Professor Raj Chetty, Harvard University  
**Institution**: Harvard University

This course introduced me to frontier social science research and how big data can address some of todayâ€™s most pressing social and economic problems. I applied quantitative methods like regression, causal inference, and machine learning to real-world datasets, working to generate actionable insights for policy-making and research.

## Projects

### **Project Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis**

- **Goal**: Explore and analyze community data, focusing on upward mobility, incarceration, and racial disparities using Opportunity Atlas.
- **Focus**: Visualizing spatial variations, understanding the relationship between rent and income mobility, and evaluating key factors such as education, healthcare, and public goods.
- **Key Methods**: Data visualization, correlation analysis, summary statistics, regression models.

**Summary**: In this project, I used data from the Opportunity Atlas to analyze economic mobility in Evanston, IL. I focused on how factors like rent, education levels, and social capital affect upward mobility in different census tracts. My analysis revealed the impact of disparities in educational access and housing costs on economic outcomes.

### **Project Part 2: Causal Analysis and Hypothesis Testing**

- **Goal**: Test hypotheses related to economic mobility and key factors influencing social outcomes.
- **Focus**: Conducting a causal analysis to investigate the relationships between education, public spaces, and proximity to crime on mobility.
- **Key Methods**: Regression analysis, causal inference, difference-in-differences (DiD), synthetic control methods.

**Highlight**: I employed **synthetic control methods** and **propensity score matching** to identify the causal effect of public spaces and educational attainment on upward mobility. These advanced techniques helped me control for confounders and improve the robustness of my results, allowing for more accurate policy recommendations.

## Labs

### **Lab 1: Introductory Data Exploration**

- **Goal**: Analyze Opportunity Atlas data to understand basic economic mobility trends.
- **Focus**: Perform descriptive analysis and summarize data trends.
- **Key Methods**: Summary statistics, data visualization (histograms and scatter plots).

### **Lab 2: Investigating Upward Mobility**

- **Goal**: Investigate intergenerational mobility using economic indicators.
- **Focus**: Explore mobility differences across demographic groups.
- **Key Methods**: Rank-rank regression, binned scatter plots, correlation analysis.

### **Lab 3: Predictive Models for Mobility**

- **Goal**: Develop decision trees and random forests to predict social mobility.
- **Focus**: Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.
- **Key Methods**: **Random forests**, decision trees, cross-validation, RMSE.

**Highlight**: I applied **cross-validation** and **random forests** to predict economic mobility. By tuning the tree depth and using random forests, I was able to reduce overfitting and significantly improve model accuracy.

### **Lab 4: Causal Inference with Regression Discontinuity**

- **Goal**: Investigate education outcomes using regression discontinuity design (RDD).
- **Focus**: Understand the causal impact of education policies on student outcomes.
- **Key Methods**: Regression discontinuity design (RDD), binned scatter plots.

### **Lab 5: Bias in Healthcare Algorithms**

- **Goal**: Investigate bias in healthcare algorithms and explore the implications of using race as a predictive feature.
- **Focus**: Analyze prediction outcomes with and without race as a feature in healthcare algorithms.
- **Key Methods**: Random forests, variable importance analysis, fairness in algorithms.

### **Lab 6: Environmental and Economic Impacts of Air Pollution**

- **Goal**: Analyze the relationship between air pollution and economic outcomes.
- **Focus**: Investigate how pollution levels impact mobility and income inequality.
- **Key Methods**: Difference-in-differences (DiD), scatter plots, regression analysis.

### **Lab 7: Social Capital and Economic Mobility**

- **Goal**: Analyze the role of social capital in fostering upward mobility.
- **Focus**: Examine economic connectedness, social cohesion, and community engagement as factors influencing mobility.
- **Key Methods**: Correlation analysis, network data, and regression models.

### **Lab 8: Historical Impact of Redlining on Mobility**

- **Goal**: Investigate the long-term impact of redlining policies on modern economic mobility.
- **Focus**: Use historical housing data to evaluate racial disparities and economic outcomes.
- **Key Methods**: Regression analysis, policy analysis, binned scatter plots.

### **Lab 9: Public Policies and Health Outcomes**

- **Goal**: Evaluate the impact of public health policies on economic and health outcomes.
- **Focus**: Use hazard models to assess the long-term effects of health interventions.
- **Key Methods**: Hazard models, difference-in-differences (DiD), policy evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: R, Stata
- **Key Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `randomForest`, `ggplot2`
- **Datasets**: Opportunity Atlas, health and mobility datasets
